/*
JavaScript allows for the nesting of functions and grants the inner 
function full access to all the variables and functions defined 
inside the outer function. However, the outer function does not have
access to the variables and functions defined inside the inner function.
This provides a sort of encapsulation for the variables of the inner 
function.
