# BOOTCAMP

An assignment in which I have to create a FORM which will accept Name(text), Age(number), Birth District(dropdown), Birth State(Disabled dropdown) Birth District will be cascaded with Birth State means Birth State will be selected automatically when Birth District is selected.

On submission all of this data will be displayed in a table with serial no. and it will have 2 buttons one for editing data and another for deleting data.

On editing data will be sent to form and will be updated in table on submission.

On deleting data will be deleted from table and re-indexing will be done to maintain serial numbers.
